Welcome! I am a Lecturer in Comparative Politics in the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). Before joining Essex, I worked at [Aarhus University](http://www.au.dk/en/) as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en/), and [University of Zurich](http://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html) as a pre-/post-doctoral fellow. I earned my Ph.D. in [Political Science](http://politicalscience.rice.edu) in 2015 from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). 

I study Comparative Politics and Political Behavior. My research embraces three substantive questions: 1) How political contexts influence the way people engage and orient themselves in politics, 2) How voters repond to policy initiatives (such as electoral platforms and welfare policy reforms) and assign responsibility to political parties and governments, and 3) How different political contexts and information environments influence these processes and outcomes. 

As my research links macro-level political contexts to micro-level political behavior, my interests touch on various themes in political psychology, public opinion, political institutions, and elections and parties. See [here](menu/research.html) for more about my published and on-going research projects.
